# Audit Remediation — Queue

Source of truth for `/audit-remediation-iteration`. Each iteration reads this
file, picks the top non-blocked item per `REMEDIATION_DEFAULTS.md` priority
order, does it, then edits this file to advance the queue before committing.

See also: `REMEDIATION_DEFAULTS.md` (priority weights + work-sizing rules),
`MERGE_AUTHORIZATION.md` (tier policy), `REMEDIATION_QUEUE_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`
(iteration log entries older than ~30 iterations).

## Blocked — needs human input

### CL-05 — WHOIS domain privacy (registrar action required)

WHOIS for invest.com.au may expose registrant personal details. This cannot
be fixed in code — it requires enabling WHOIS privacy through the domain
registrar for `invest.com.au`. Steps:
1. Log in to the domain registrar where `invest.com.au` is registered.
2. Find "WHOIS Privacy", "Domain Privacy", or "Privacy Protection" in domain management.
3. Enable it. This replaces personal details in the WHOIS record with the registrar's proxy contact.
4. Allow 24–48 hours for WHOIS propagation.

Once done, delete this blocked entry and mark CL-05 as done in the stream table.

### Dependency vulnerabilities systemic failure (3 in-flight PRs: #800, #803, #807) — 2026-05-14

**RESOLVED 2026-05-14 (iter 395):** PRs #800, #803, #807 were merged directly by founder. Iter 394's root-cause analysis was incorrect — the `--audit-level=high` threshold in CI already excluded the remaining moderate PostCSS CVE. The actual HIGH-severity CVEs were from `next@16.2.4` (13 CVEs fixed in #793). Those branches simply predated PR #793's merge and still had 16.2.4 in their `package-lock.json`. The systemic block evaporated once the branches were merged (picking up 16.2.6 from main). **This blocked entry can be deleted by the founder.**

~~The `Dependency vulnerabilities` CI check is failing on three in-flight PRs simultaneously, triggering the same-gate cluster guard (≥3 PRs, same check name). Surfaced by iter 394.~~

### Accessibility (axe-core on key routes) systemic failure — 2026-05-15

**Pre-existing in main; not caused by any stream PR.** `Accessibility (axe-core on key routes)` CI check is failing on in-flight PR #845 (LL-04) and was also failing on founder PRs #846 and #850 (both admin-merged past the failure). Diagnosed in iter 402.

**Key facts:**
- The a11y job runs against a local Next.js build with placeholder Supabase creds — NOT the Vercel preview.
- The 8 tested routes are: `/, /glossary, /tools, /foreign-investment, /about, /how-we-earn, /privacy, /terms`.
- LL-04's changes only touch `app/account/*` — none of the 8 tested routes — confirming the failure is not caused by the stream.
- PR #846 (founder marketplace PR, independent branch) also fails the same check; PR #850 (merged to main 2026-05-15) also fails.
- `Lint · Type-check · Test · Build` passes; only the a11y gate fails.
- The specific critical axe-core rule is unknown without CI job logs (`gh run view --job 76104276977 --log-failed`); the loop's cloud env cannot access those logs.
- `Lighthouse — Core Web Vitals (advisory)` is also failing but is advisory-only (non-blocking).
- `Preview smoke test` failure on #845 is a Vercel preview timing issue — PR #850 passes it.
- PRs #847, #848, #849 have CI bypass/not-triggered, so axe-core is only confirmed failing on #845.

**Effect on auto-merge:** PR #845 cannot auto-merge while axe-core is red. PRs #848 (EM) and #849 (LX) have CI bypass and are unaffected.

**Recommendation matrix:**
- **(a) Fix root cause — recommended:** Run `gh run view --job 76104276977 --log-failed` locally (needs `gh` CLI auth) to get the exact critical rule name and failing node. Fix on a `fix/a11y-<rule>` branch targeting main; all stream PRs pick it up on next update.
- **(b) Admin-merge #845 past the failure:** Founder admin-merges #845 (LL-04) as done for #846 and #850. The underlying violation remains.
- **(c) Gate reconfiguration:** If the violation is known runner noise from placeholder creds, add the specific rule to `DISABLED_RULES` in `e2e/a11y.spec.ts` with a dated comment, open a PR to main.

**To resolve:** Delete this blocked entry once (a), (b), or (c) is actioned and PR #845 shows green Accessibility check.

## Resolved as false positives

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| CL-07 (social media entity-only) | Source code social links are entity-level: `@investcomau` on X/Twitter, `linkedin.com/company/invest-com-au`. No personal founder accounts referenced in shipped code. |
| CL-08 (press inquiry handling) | `app/press/page.tsx` and `app/contact/page.tsx` already use `press@invest.com.au` (role address). No founder personal email in code. |
| MM-V05 (alternative collectibles listings) | `app/invest/alternatives/listings/page.tsx` exists on main and covers all MM-V05 sub-categories (whisky, wine, art, watches, cars, coins, etc.) via `ALTERNATIVES_SUB_CATEGORIES`. No new page needed. |

- **Diff:** +24 -0 in `lib/database.types.ts` (hub_drip_log table added)
- **Root cause:** EM-02 migration (PR #880) added `hub_drip_log` to the live Supabase DB. `lib/database.types.ts` on main didn't have this table, causing `Supabase types drift` to fail on #881. Fix: regenerated types via Supabase MCP, committed `chore(db): regenerate database.types.ts (auto-rescue)` directly to main (`c5113b7`), then rebased the GT branch onto main to pick it up.

New daily cron `app/api/cron/hub-subscriber-drip` (registered in `daily-10` alongside welcome-drip, advisor-onboarding, abandoned-quiz-drip): queries confirmed hub newsletter subscribers from `newsletter_subscriptions`, sends a 3-step welcome drip keyed off `confirmed_at` — Step 1 (Day 0–3) welcome + top resource, Step 2 (Day 5–9) calculator/tool CTA, Step 3 (Day 14–30) advisor CTA + series close. Covers 9 hub segments: smsf-hub, dividends-hub, wholesale-hub, property-hub, super-hub, insurance-hub, foreign-investment-hub, private-markets-hub, first-home-buyer-hub. `lib/database.types.ts` updated with hub_drip_log type stub.

TypeScript strict mode raised a type error on all 9 literals.

- **What:** Created `lib/prefill-url.ts` as the SSOT for building pre-filled /find-advisor and /quiz URLs. `buildAdvisorUrl({ need, state?, postcode?, budget?, firstName? })` produces canonical URLs; `buildQuizUrl({ vertical, state? })` does the same for /quiz. Updated `FindAdvisorQuiz` in `app/find-advisor/page.tsx` to read `?state`, `?postcode`, `?budget`, `?first_name` URL params alongside the existing `?need` — applied to useState initializer so Steps 3+4 are pre-populated when the user reaches them. Late-navigation useEffect also re-applies. Updated `AdvisorMatchCTA` to accept optional `state`/`postcode`/`budget` props and route through `buildAdvisorUrl` — backward-compatible, no callers broken.

- **Diff:** +386 -2 across 5 files (1 new component, 1 new lib config, 2 new pages, 1 sitemap update)
- **What:** Built the generic hub onboarding shell and first two hub configs. `HubOnboardingShell` wraps `<EligibilityQuiz>` (W-10) and accepts a `HubOnboardingConfig` with hub-specific questions and an `evaluate(answers)` function. On completion the evaluate function returns a `HubOnboardingResult` (headline, summary, primaryCta, optional secondaryCta, optional advisorCta rendered as a "want expert advice?" card). `lib/hub-onboarding-configs.ts` defines `SMSF_ONBOARDING_CONFIG` (3 questions, 5 result branches: current trustee / under-balance / property-goal / ready+balance / default) and `DIVIDENDS_ONBOARDING_CONFIG` (3 questions, 4 result branches: SMSF+franking / income / growth / exploring).

- **Phase:** 1.7 + 2 — main CI preflight + CI rescue check
- **What:** Diagnosed `Accessibility (axe-core on key routes)` failure on PR #845 as a pre-existing main-codebase issue, not caused by LL-04's changes. Confirmed by: (1) LL-04 only touches `app/account/*` files, none of the 8 tested public routes; (2) founder PR #846 (independent branch) also fails; (3) PR #850 (merged to main today) also fails. The core CI (`Lint · Type-check · Test · Build`) is passing on all PRs — only the a11y gate fails. A previous concurrent session (running during iter 401's LX-01 fire) placed a blocked queue entry on the LL-04 branch rather than main — this iter 402 commit moves that entry to main where it belongs.
- **In-flight PR CI summary:** #845 (LL-04): axe-core FAILURE + Preview smoke timing + advisory LH. #847 (RR-02): only Vercel check visible (CI may not have triggered on latest commit). #848 (EM-03): CI bypass. #849 (LX-01): CI bypass.

- **What:** Viral deep-link sharing for all four main calculators. New `CalculatorShareButton` client component calls `buildShareableUrl(pathname, key, state)` from `hooks/use-calculator-state` to produce a URL with state encoded in the query string; copies to clipboard (falls back to `window.prompt` on non-HTTPS). Integrated into `CompoundInterestClient` (new share button in results panel). Upgraded `handleShare` in `MortgageCalculatorClient`, `SMSFCalculatorClient`, `SavingsCalculatorClient` to pass a deep link through `navigator.share` / clipboard copy — pre-existing share buttons now produce live-state URLs instead of bare origin URLs.

New `<HubNewsletterCapture>` client component posts to `/api/newsletter-segments/subscribe` with hub's segment slug; success/429/error states; accessible. Added `newsletterCapture?: ReactNode` slot to `<HubPage>` (positioned after advisorCta). Populated `newsletter: { listKey, cadence }` on `SMSF_HUB_CONFIG` and `DIVIDENDS_HUB_CONFIG`.

- **PR:** #847 OPEN
- **Commit:** `c53761d`

- **Root cause:** `Lint · Type-check · Test · Build` CI failing with TS2352 in `app/advisor-portal/reviews/page.tsx`. Supabase nested select returns `professional_review_responses` as an array; the original code attempted to spread that into a `ReviewWithResponse` (which expects `advisor_response` singular), hitting "neither type sufficiently overlaps". Fix: introduced an explicit `RawReview` intermediate type and mapped it cleanly to `ReviewWithResponse`, picking `professional_review_responses[0]` into `advisor_response`.
- **Local verification:** `npm run type-check` → clean; 7 tests pass; lint clean; JSON-LD gate ✅; rate-limit audit 100%.

### iter 398 — 2026-05-14 — RR-01 FP + RR-02 advisor-review-responses

- **Stream:** RR (review extensions)
- **Phase:** 3–7 — pick, verify, do, commit, push
- **PR:** #847 OPEN
- **Branch:** `claude/audit-remediation/rr-01-review-extensions`
- **Commit:** `8547e70`
- **Diff:** +407 -2 across 8 files (1 migration, 2 new API route, 2 new portal pages, 1 type update, 1 query update, 1 test suite)
- **RR-01:** Resolved as **false-positive** — `VerifiedClientBadge` component already implemented and wired into `UserReviewsList` and `AdvisorProfileClient`. No new code needed.
- **RR-02:** Advisor response to reviews. New `professional_review_responses` table (migration `20260726_rr02_…`), POST `/api/advisor-portal/reviews/respond` (rate-limited 10/60s, upsert pattern), advisor-portal reviews page (`/advisor-portal/reviews`) showing all approved+pending reviews with inline response forms, advisor response display in public profile, 7-test suite (all green).

### iter 397 — 2026-05-14 — CI-RESCUE LL (#845)

- **Stream:** LL (logged-in user infrastructure)
- **Phase:** 2 — CI rescue
- **PR:** #845 OPEN
- **Commit:** `c7854e1`
- **Diff:** +1 -0 (1 file — scripts/check-jsonld-coverage.mjs)
- **Root cause:** `Lint · Type-check · Test · Build` CI job failing at the "JSON-LD coverage gate" step. `app/teams/[slug]/referrals/page.tsx` (added in main via PR #839) is an auth-gated advisor-portal page with no public SEO surface, but the gate was treating it as a public content route because `teams` was not in `EXEMPT_ROUTE_PATTERNS`. Fix: added `{ prefix: "teams", category: "PORTAL" }` to the exemption list with a comment. The public team profile (`/teams/[slug]`) already emits JSON-LD voluntarily — exempting the prefix does not regress public coverage.
- **Local verification:** `node scripts/check-jsonld-coverage.mjs` → ✅ All public routes emit JSON-LD; `npm run audit:rate-limits -- --strict` → 100%; vitest on test file → 6/6 pass.

### iter 396 — 2026-05-14 — LL-04 [Tier-1 preempt]

- **Stream:** LL (logged-in user infrastructure)
- **Item:** LL-04 — reviews + ratings history
- **Branch:** `claude/audit-remediation/ll-04-reviews-ratings`
- **PR:** #845 OPEN
- **Commit:** `3fca3fe`
- **Diff:** +399 -4 across 5 files (3 new, 2 modified)
- **What:** Built the account-side reviews + ratings surface for logged-in investors. New `GET /api/account/reviews` route returns all of the authenticated user's broker reviews regardless of moderation status (standard RLS only shows `status='approved'`; admin client scoped to caller's own email provides the full history). New `app/account/reviews/page.tsx` RSC displays review cards with status badges (pending/approved/rejected), star rows, broker links, and a "View live →" link for approved reviews; empty-state has CTA to `/reviews/write`. Added optional `reviewCount` prop to `AccountKindCards` — when >0 renders an amber "My reviews" tile (follows the `savedSearchCount` pattern). `app/account/page.tsx` parallel-fetches the count (HEAD query via admin client) and threads it through. 5-test suite covers 401 paths, happy path, all-statuses, DB error, and null→[] normalisation. Rate-limit audit 100% (421 routes, 0 missing). LL-05 blocked (deps V-NEW-02 + CC-06).

### iter 395 — 2026-05-14 — queue sync (all in-flight PRs merged by founder)

- **Stream:** all streams (queue housekeeping)
- **Phase:** 7 — queue update
- **What:** Comprehensive queue sync. All previously "OPEN" in-flight PRs were found merged or closed by founder before this iteration ran: #749 (KK-04 iter 4) ✓, #751 (KK-04 iter 5) ✓, #795 (CL) ✓, #799 (TT-04) ✓, #800 (QQ) ✓, #803 (MM) ✓, #807 (LL) ✓, #793 (MAIN-RESCUE) ✓. #782 (CMP) was closed without merging. Dep-vuln blocked entry corrected: iter 394's root cause was wrong — CI was already at `--audit-level=high`; the actual issue was that those branches predated #793's `next 16.2.4→16.2.6` patch. Block is now moot (PRs merged).
- **Main CI note:** Two non-loop auto-revert PRs pending: #827 (reverts `d26094aa` — tax-year CSV export) and #843 (reverts `ff43ed6f` — cron dispatcher wiring). These are founder-action items. Loop will not open new stream PRs until main CI is confirmed green.
- **Next item (when main CI clear):** LL-04 (reviews + ratings, Tier-1 preempt) on new branch from main.

### iter 394 — 2026-05-14 — dep-vuln systemic cluster-guard

- **Stream:** systemic (QQ #800, MM #803, LL #807)
- **Phase:** 2 — CI rescue check
- **Trigger:** Same-gate cluster guard: `Dependency vulnerabilities` failing on 3 in-flight PRs simultaneously
- **Root cause:** `postcss < 8.5.10` (GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93, moderate) bundled inside next.js ≤16.2.6. No safe upgrade path — next@16.3.0 stable not yet released.
- **Additional per-PR failures (not systemic):** #803: Accessibility (axe-core) + Preview smoke test; #807: Accessibility (axe-core). These will be rescued once dep-vuln gate is resolved.

- **PR:** #807 OPEN
- **Commit:** `a2c6f27`
- **Diff:** +171 -5 across 3 files (2 new files, 1 modified)
- **What:** Watchlist page already existed (false-positive on watchlist sub-feature). Delivered the email digest preferences part: created `app/api/account/digest-prefs/route.ts` (GET returns `{ watchlist_digest, advisor_digest }` from `investor_profiles.meta`; PUT merges new pref keys into meta via `upsertInvestorProfile()` — no schema migration needed, uses existing JSONB `meta` column). Created `app/account/watchlist/DigestToggle.tsx` — accessible toggle switch (`role=switch`, `aria-checked`) with optimistic update + rollback on error. Extended `app/account/watchlist/page.tsx` to parallel-fetch investor profile alongside watchlist items and render a "Email notifications" card at the bottom with the DigestToggle wired to `watchlist_digest` key. LL-04 (reviews + ratings) pending; LL-05 (live chat) blocked on V-NEW-02 + CC-06.

- **PR:** #807 OPEN
- **Commit:** `b9d0631`
- **Diff:** +285 -1 across 2 files
- **What:** Created `app/api/account/advisor-matches/route.ts` — authenticated GET route returning top-6 advisors matched to the logged-in user's investor profile. Auth via `createClient()`, profile flags via `getInvestorProfile()`. Priority chain: `isFhb`→`mortgage_broker` | `isPreRetiree`→`retirement_planning` specialty (`.contains`) | `isHnw`→`investment_advice` specialty | `isBusinessOwner`→`business_advisory` specialty | `isCrossBorder`→`accepts_international=true` | else top-rated. Budget filter: `.or("min_investment_cents.is.null,min_investment_cents.lte.${budgetMax}")`. Returns `AdvisorMatchesResponse { advisors, match_basis }` with exported types for future callers. Also extended `app/account/dashboard/page.tsx`: added `fetchMatchedAdvisors()` RSC helper (same logic, limit 3), `AdvisorMatch` type, `BUDGET_MAX` constant, advisor grid section below recommended-for-you (shows photo via `next/image`, name, firm, location, star rating; hidden when no results). Unblocks: LX-02, LX-04, GT-01/02, DF-01..04, AT-01..04, CD-01, DV-01 — all now have both LL-01 and LL-02 landed.

- **PR:** #807 OPEN
- **Commit:** `8008bf1`
- **Diff:** +296 -0 (1 new file)
- **What:** Built `app/account/dashboard/page.tsx` — RSC personal financial dashboard for the investor portal. `enforcePortalKind("investor")` gate. Five parallel Supabase queries (user_profiles, investor_goals, investor_holdings, user_watchlist_items, investor_profiles). Sections: welcome header, financial snapshot (3 clickable snapshot cards), nearest-goal progress bar (with formatted dollars + % progress), profile completeness nudge (blue card, progress bar, hidden at 100%), personalised recommended-for-you actions (driven by investor_profile flags: is_fhb→/first-home-buyer, is_pre_retiree→/super, is_hnw→/wholesale, is_cross_border→/foreign-investment, is_business_owner→/account/upgrade/business; fallback to /quiz + /find-advisor), 10-card account navigation grid. No schema migration — uses existing tables. Note: user_profiles not yet in database.types.ts (types drift pre-existing); query works at runtime via Supabase schema API. Unblocks LL-02, LX-02, LX-04, GT-01/02, DF-01..04, AT-01..04, CD-01, DV-01.

- **Diff:** +59 -0 across 4 files (new page + `'livestock'` type union member + listing-url entry + 2 sitemap rows)
- **What:** Created `/invest/livestock/listings/page.tsx` following the established vertical listings pattern (ISR 300s, `generateMetadata` with live count, breadcrumb JSON-LD, `InvestListingsClient` locked to the new vertical). Added `'livestock'` to `InvestListingVertical` union in `lib/types.ts` (alphabetically between 'fund' and 'mining'). Added `livestock: "livestock"` to `VERTICAL_TO_CATEGORY` in `lib/listing-url.ts`. Registered `/invest/livestock` and `/invest/livestock/listings` in `app/sitemap.ts`. Sub-categories per MM-V08 plan: thoroughbred racehorse syndication (Magic Millions, Inglis), cattle herd investment (Wagyu, Angus, Brahman), sheep/wool programs, stud/breeding rights, genetic programs.
