# Audit Remediation — Queue

Source of truth for `/audit-remediation-iteration`. Each iteration reads this
file, picks the top non-blocked item per `REMEDIATION_DEFAULTS.md` priority
order, does it, then edits this file to advance the queue before committing.

See also: `REMEDIATION_DEFAULTS.md` (priority weights + work-sizing rules),

## Blocked — needs human input

### CL-05 — WHOIS domain privacy (registrar action required)

WHOIS for invest.com.au may expose registrant personal details. This cannot
be fixed in code — it requires enabling WHOIS privacy through the domain
registrar for `invest.com.au`. Steps:
1. Log in to the domain registrar where `invest.com.au` is registered.
2. Find "WHOIS Privacy", "Domain Privacy", or "Privacy Protection" in domain management.
3. Enable it. This replaces personal details in the WHOIS record with the registrar's proxy contact.
4. Allow 24–48 hours for WHOIS propagation.

Once done, delete this blocked entry and mark CL-05 as done in the stream table.

### Dependency vulnerabilities systemic failure (3 in-flight PRs: #800, #803, #807) — 2026-05-14

**RESOLVED 2026-05-14 (iter 395):** PRs #800, #803, #807 were merged directly by founder. Iter 394's root-cause analysis was incorrect — the `--audit-level=high` threshold in CI already excluded the remaining moderate PostCSS CVE. The actual HIGH-severity CVEs were from `next@16.2.4` (13 CVEs fixed in #793). Those branches simply predated PR #793's merge and still had 16.2.4 in their `package-lock.json`. The systemic block evaporated once the branches were merged (picking up 16.2.6 from main). **This blocked entry can be deleted by the founder.**

~~The `Dependency vulnerabilities` CI check is failing on three in-flight PRs simultaneously, triggering the same-gate cluster guard (≥3 PRs, same check name). Surfaced by iter 394.~~

### Accessibility (axe-core on key routes) systemic failure — 2026-05-15

**Pre-existing in main; not caused by any stream PR.** `Accessibility (axe-core on key routes)` CI check is failing on in-flight PR #845 (LL-04) and was also failing on founder PRs #846 and #850 (both admin-merged past the failure). Diagnosed in iter 402.

**Key facts:**
- The a11y job runs against a local Next.js build with placeholder Supabase creds — NOT the Vercel preview.
- The 8 tested routes are: `/, /glossary, /tools, /foreign-investment, /about, /how-we-earn, /privacy, /terms`.
- LL-04's changes only touch `app/account/*` — none of the 8 tested routes — confirming the failure is not caused by the stream.
- PR #846 (founder marketplace PR, independent branch) also fails the same check; PR #850 (merged to main 2026-05-15) also fails.
- `Lint · Type-check · Test · Build` passes; only the a11y gate fails.
- The specific critical axe-core rule is unknown without CI job logs (`gh run view --job 76104276977 --log-failed`); the loop's cloud env cannot access those logs.
- `Lighthouse — Core Web Vitals (advisory)` is also failing but is advisory-only (non-blocking).
- `Preview smoke test` failure on #845 is a Vercel preview timing issue — PR #850 passes it.
- PRs #847, #848, #849 have CI bypass/not-triggered, so axe-core is only confirmed failing on #845.

**Effect on auto-merge:** PR #845 cannot auto-merge while axe-core is red. PRs #848 (EM) and #849 (LX) have CI bypass and are unaffected.

**Recommendation matrix:**
- **(a) Fix root cause — recommended:** Run `gh run view --job 76104276977 --log-failed` locally (needs `gh` CLI auth) to get the exact critical rule name and failing node. Fix on a `fix/a11y-<rule>` branch targeting main; all stream PRs pick it up on next update.
- **(b) Admin-merge #845 past the failure:** Founder admin-merges #845 (LL-04) as done for #846 and #850. The underlying violation remains.
- **(c) Gate reconfiguration:** If the violation is known runner noise from placeholder creds, add the specific rule to `DISABLED_RULES` in `e2e/a11y.spec.ts` with a dated comment, open a PR to main.

**To resolve:** Delete this blocked entry once (a), (b), or (c) is actioned and PR #845 shows green Accessibility check.

## Resolved as false positives

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| CL-07 (social media entity-only) | Source code social links are entity-level: `@investcomau` on X/Twitter, `linkedin.com/company/invest-com-au`. No personal founder accounts referenced in shipped code. |
| CL-08 (press inquiry handling) | `app/press/page.tsx` and `app/contact/page.tsx` already use `press@invest.com.au` (role address). No founder personal email in code. |
| MM-V05 (alternative collectibles listings) | `app/invest/alternatives/listings/page.tsx` exists on main and covers all MM-V05 sub-categories (whisky, wine, art, watches, cars, coins, etc.) via `ALTERNATIVES_SUB_CATEGORIES`. No new page needed. |

- **Phase:** 2 — CI rescue
- **PR:** #852 OPEN
- **Commit:** `4872612`
- **Diff:** +4 -0 (2 files — app/etfs/quiz/page.tsx, app/property/quiz/page.tsx)
- **Root cause:** `Lint · Type-check · Test · Build` CI failing because `__tests__/lib/afsl-compliance-coverage.test.ts` requires every page under `app/etfs` and `app/property` to include `ComplianceFooter`, `PropertyDisclaimer`, or `GENERAL_ADVICE_WARNING`. The new `/etfs/quiz` and `/property/quiz` pages (OB-04 and OB-03) were missing this. Both pages produce personalised financial product recommendations (specific ETF tickers, property strategies) which are in scope for s912D general-advice disclosure. Fix: added `<ComplianceFooter className="mt-8 mx-4" />` to both pages. All 37 AFSL compliance tests now green. TSC, lint, and rate-limits audit all pass locally.

- **Commit:** `511976fc`
- **Diff:** +273 -0 across 4 files (2 new files, 2 hub pages updated)
- **What:** `lib/lead-magnets.ts` — 12-entry registry, one per hub (SMSF trustee checklist, franking credits guide, wholesale checklist, property DD checklist, negative-gearing estimator, ETF selection guide, super comparison guide, crypto tax guide, business-sale checklist, FIRB guide, lump-sum guide, aged-care planning guide). `getLeadMagnetForHub(hubSlug)` helper. `components/LeadMagnetCapture.tsx` — "use client" email-gate card: amber gradient, cover icon, PDF title/description, email input → POST `/api/newsletter-segments/subscribe` → on success shows direct "Download Now" `<a download>` button + email-copy note. Handles 429 and network errors. `app/smsf/page.tsx`: wires SMSF magnet (trustee checklist) between guide cross-link and featured articles. `app/dividends/page.tsx`: wires dividends magnet (franking credits guide) between SMSF crossover callout and platform CTA.

### iter 407 — 2026-05-15 — CI-RESCUE OB (#852)

- **Stream:** OB (hub onboarding flows)
- **Phase:** 2 — CI rescue
- **PR:** #852 OPEN
- **Commit:** `b680c6f0`
- **Diff:** +1 -1 (1 file — components/HubOnboardingShell.tsx)
- **Root cause:** `HubOnboardingResult.advisorCta` type declared `label: string` as required, but the `HubOnboardingShell` renders a hardcoded "Find an Adviser" button text (never reads `label`) and all 9 `advisorCta` object literals in `lib/hub-onboarding-configs.ts` omitted the field. TypeScript strict mode raised a type error on all 9 literals. Fix: removed `label: string` from the `advisorCta` type — the field is unused in the component and was a copy-paste artefact from `primaryCta`/`secondaryCta`.

- **PR:** #849 OPEN
- **Commit:** `375d665`
- **Diff:** +4 -0 (2 files — app/dividends/page.tsx, app/smsf/page.tsx)
- **Root cause:** LX-05 placed `<HubExitIntent>` as a JSX sibling to `<HubPage>` without a Fragment wrapper in both `app/dividends/page.tsx` and `app/smsf/page.tsx`. TypeScript raised TS2657 "JSX expressions must have one parent element", failing `Lint · Type-check · Test · Build`. Fix: added `<>…</>` Fragment wrapper in both return statements.

- **Commit:** `b2d527c6`
- **Diff:** +169 -0 across 3 files (1 new component, 2 hub pages)
- **What:** `HubExitIntent` "use client" component — fires on `mouseleave` through viewport top after ≥20s engagement, uses shared `exitIntentShown` sessionStorage key to coordinate with global `ExitIntentPopup` (no double-fire). Modal shows hub-specific headline + email capture form. Submits to `/api/newsletter-segments/subscribe` with the hub's segment slug for hub-specific drip sequences. Wired into `/smsf` (segmentSlug=smsf-hub) and `/dividends` (segmentSlug=dividends-hub). Accessible: role=dialog, aria-modal, aria-labelledby, close button with aria-label.

- **PR:** #849 OPEN
- **Commit:** `c0a52b7b`
- **Diff:** +106 -6 across 3 files (1 new lib, 2 modified)
- **What:** Created `lib/prefill-url.ts` as the SSOT for building pre-filled /find-advisor and /quiz URLs. `buildAdvisorUrl({ need, state?, postcode?, budget?, firstName? })` produces canonical URLs; `buildQuizUrl({ vertical, state? })` does the same for /quiz. Updated `FindAdvisorQuiz` in `app/find-advisor/page.tsx` to read `?state`, `?postcode`, `?budget`, `?first_name` URL params alongside the existing `?need` — applied to useState initializer so Steps 3+4 are pre-populated when the user reaches them. Late-navigation useEffect also re-applies. Updated `AdvisorMatchCTA` to accept optional `state`/`postcode`/`budget` props and route through `buildAdvisorUrl` — backward-compatible, no callers broken.

- **Commit:** `e654f70`
- **Diff:** +386 -2 across 5 files (1 new component, 1 new lib config, 2 new pages, 1 sitemap update)
- **What:** Built the generic hub onboarding shell and first two hub configs. `HubOnboardingShell` wraps `<EligibilityQuiz>` (W-10) and accepts a `HubOnboardingConfig` with hub-specific questions and an `evaluate(answers)` function. On completion the evaluate function returns a `HubOnboardingResult` (headline, summary, primaryCta, optional secondaryCta, optional advisorCta rendered as a "want expert advice?" card). `lib/hub-onboarding-configs.ts` defines `SMSF_ONBOARDING_CONFIG` (3 questions, 5 result branches: current trustee / under-balance / property-goal / ready+balance / default) and `DIVIDENDS_ONBOARDING_CONFIG` (3 questions, 4 result branches: SMSF+franking / income / growth / exploring). Pages at `/smsf/quiz` and `/dividends/quiz` (ISR 86400, breadcrumb JSON-LD, canonicals). OB-02..OB-13 (11 remaining hub configs) are the next iterations in this stream.

- **Stream:** systemic (main shared codebase → in-flight PR #845 LL-04)
- **Phase:** 1.7 + 2 — main CI preflight + CI rescue check
- **What:** Diagnosed `Accessibility (axe-core on key routes)` failure on PR #845 as a pre-existing main-codebase issue, not caused by LL-04's changes. Confirmed by: (1) LL-04 only touches `app/account/*` files, none of the 8 tested public routes; (2) founder PR #846 (independent branch) also fails; (3) PR #850 (merged to main today) also fails. The core CI (`Lint · Type-check · Test · Build`) is passing on all PRs — only the a11y gate fails. A previous concurrent session (running during iter 401's LX-01 fire) placed a blocked queue entry on the LL-04 branch rather than main — this iter 402 commit moves that entry to main where it belongs.
- **In-flight PR CI summary:** #845 (LL-04): axe-core FAILURE + Preview smoke timing + advisory LH. #847 (RR-02): only Vercel check visible (CI may not have triggered on latest commit). #848 (EM-03): CI bypass. #849 (LX-01): CI bypass.
- **Note:** `Preview smoke test` failure on #845 is a Vercel preview timing issue (not ready within 6-min window) — #850 passes it, confirming no structural regression.

- **Diff:** +104 -4 across 5 files (1 new component, 4 calculator pages updated)
- **What:** Viral deep-link sharing for all four main calculators. New `CalculatorShareButton` client component calls `buildShareableUrl(pathname, key, state)` from `hooks/use-calculator-state` to produce a URL with state encoded in the query string; copies to clipboard (falls back to `window.prompt` on non-HTTPS). Integrated into `CompoundInterestClient` (new share button in results panel). Upgraded `handleShare` in `MortgageCalculatorClient`, `SMSFCalculatorClient`, `SavingsCalculatorClient` to pass a deep link through `navigator.share` / clipboard copy — pre-existing share buttons now produce live-state URLs instead of bare origin URLs.

- **What:** Foundational email list-building layer for all content hubs. Migration seeds 12 hub-specific `newsletter_segments` rows (smsf-hub, dividends-hub, wholesale-hub, etc.) so the segment-aware subscribe API accepts hub slugs without 400 errors. New `<HubNewsletterCapture>` client component posts to `/api/newsletter-segments/subscribe` with hub's segment slug; success/429/error states; accessible. Added `newsletterCapture?: ReactNode` slot to `<HubPage>` (positioned after advisorCta). Populated `newsletter: { listKey, cadence }` on `SMSF_HUB_CONFIG` and `DIVIDENDS_HUB_CONFIG`. Wired `<HubNewsletterCapture>` into `/smsf` and `/dividends` hub pages.

- **PR:** #847 OPEN
- **Commit:** `c53761d`
- **Diff:** +21 -5 (1 file — app/advisor-portal/reviews/page.tsx)
- **Root cause:** `Lint · Type-check · Test · Build` CI failing with TS2352 in `app/advisor-portal/reviews/page.tsx`. Supabase nested select returns `professional_review_responses` as an array; the original code attempted to spread that into a `ReviewWithResponse` (which expects `advisor_response` singular), hitting "neither type sufficiently overlaps". Fix: introduced an explicit `RawReview` intermediate type and mapped it cleanly to `ReviewWithResponse`, picking `professional_review_responses[0]` into `advisor_response`.

- **PR:** #845 OPEN
- **Commit:** `c7854e1`
- **Diff:** +1 -0 (1 file — scripts/check-jsonld-coverage.mjs)
- **Root cause:** `Lint · Type-check · Test · Build` CI job failing at the "JSON-LD coverage gate" step. `app/teams/[slug]/referrals/page.tsx` (added in main via PR #839) is an auth-gated advisor-portal page with no public SEO surface, but the gate was treating it as a public content route because `teams` was not in `EXEMPT_ROUTE_PATTERNS`. Fix: added `{ prefix: "teams", category: "PORTAL" }` to the exemption list with a comment. The public team profile (`/teams/[slug]`) already emits JSON-LD voluntarily — exempting the prefix does not regress public coverage.
- **Local verification:** `node scripts/check-jsonld-coverage.mjs` → ✅ All public routes emit JSON-LD; `npm run audit:rate-limits -- --strict` → 100%; vitest on test file → 6/6 pass.

- **PR:** #845 OPEN
- **Commit:** `3fca3fe`
- **Diff:** +399 -4 across 5 files (3 new, 2 modified)
- **What:** Built the account-side reviews + ratings surface for logged-in investors. New `GET /api/account/reviews` route returns all of the authenticated user's broker reviews regardless of moderation status (standard RLS only shows `status='approved'`; admin client scoped to caller's own email provides the full history). New `app/account/reviews/page.tsx` RSC displays review cards with status badges (pending/approved/rejected), star rows, broker links, and a "View live →" link for approved reviews; empty-state has CTA to `/reviews/write`. Added optional `reviewCount` prop to `AccountKindCards` — when >0 renders an amber "My reviews" tile (follows the `savedSearchCount` pattern). `app/account/page.tsx` parallel-fetches the count (HEAD query via admin client) and threads it through. 5-test suite covers 401 paths, happy path, all-statuses, DB error, and null→[] normalisation. Rate-limit audit 100% (421 routes, 0 missing). LL-05 blocked (deps V-NEW-02 + CC-06).

All previously "OPEN" in-flight PRs were found merged or closed by founder before this iteration ran: #749 (KK-04 iter 4) ✓, #751 (KK-04 iter 5) ✓, #795 (CL) ✓, #799 (TT-04) ✓, #800 (QQ) ✓, #803 (MM) ✓, #807 (LL) ✓, #793 (MAIN-RESCUE) ✓. #782 (CMP) was closed without merging. Dep-vuln blocked entry corrected: iter 394's root cause was wrong — CI was already at `--audit-level=high`; the actual issue was that those branches predated #793's `next 16.2.4→16.2.6` patch. Block is now moot (PRs merged).
- **Main CI note:** Two non-loop auto-revert PRs pending: #827 (reverts `d26094aa` — tax-year CSV export) and #843 (reverts `ff43ed6f` — cron dispatcher wiring). These are founder-action items. Loop will not open new stream PRs until main CI is confirmed green.

Delivered the email digest preferences part: created `app/api/account/digest-prefs/route.ts` (GET returns `{ watchlist_digest, advisor_digest }` from `investor_profiles.meta`; PUT merges new pref keys into meta via `upsertInvestorProfile()` — no schema migration needed, uses existing JSONB `meta` column). Created `app/account/watchlist/DigestToggle.tsx` — accessible toggle switch (`role=switch`, `aria-checked`) with optimistic update + rollback on error. Extended `app/account/watchlist/page.tsx` to parallel-fetch investor profile alongside watchlist items and render a "Email notifications" card at the bottom with the DigestToggle wired to `watchlist_digest` key.

- **What:** Created `app/api/account/advisor-matches/route.ts` — authenticated GET route returning top-6 advisors matched to the logged-in user's investor profile. Auth via `createClient()`, profile flags via `getInvestorProfile()`. Priority chain: `isFhb`→`mortgage_broker` | `isPreRetiree`→`retirement_planning` specialty (`.contains`) | `isHnw`→`investment_advice` specialty | `isBusinessOwner`→`business_advisory` specialty | `isCrossBorder`→`accepts_international=true` | else top-rated. Budget filter: `.or("min_investment_cents.is.null,min_investment_cents.lte.${budgetMax}")`. Returns `AdvisorMatchesResponse { advisors, match_basis }` with exported types for future callers. Also extended `app/account/dashboard/page.tsx`: added `fetchMatchedAdvisors()` RSC helper (same logic, limit 3), `AdvisorMatch` type, `BUDGET_MAX` constant, advisor grid section below recommended-for-you (shows photo via `next/image`, name, firm, location, star rating; hidden when no results). Unblocks: LX-02, LX-04, GT-01/02, DF-01..04, AT-01..04, CD-01, DV-01 — all now have both LL-01 and LL-02 landed.
